The draw_path.py is a script that draw the path of the robot during a recorded rosbag.
It needs (in the same folder than the script):
    - The image of the airport (blagnac.jpg)
    - A text file "pose.txt" which could be obtained using the following shell command :
    rostopic echo -b your_ros_bag_file.bag -p /pose > pose.txt

The result is a image named "path.jpg".
